    "text": "My notes from the talk\n\nABM allows us to test theoretical assumptions on a micro (individual) and macro (group) level — even the simplest assumptions can be super hard to predict.\nAllowing us to predict a system on a macro level as well as individual elements/roles on that macro level.\nModels don’t need to be perfect, at least it serves the function (being useful).\nStart with very simple assumptions, therefore simple parameters. More parameters make models overfitting.\nPeople can basically refine the model parameters following up the simulation results and redo the simulations with updated parameters. But make sure to take notes on everything!\nWe could do experiments to simulate the theories under different scenarios —- Perfect for my epistemic moral beliefs project where I can simulate the predictions in a classroom setting!!!!\nCombining ABM with experiments data is perfectly possible, either use experimental results to create model parameters, or use simulation results to generate more hypotheses, making sense of conflicting experimental results.\nMore parameters (assumptions) we put in the model would make the models unnecessarily complex. Start simple!\nIn specifying the parameters we do and do not want to be super sure/specific about the accuracy or these parameters – most importantly that we need to be sure that these assumptions can be tested. In this sense, we believe that the parameters we test theoretically vary in the population.\nWhat defines a good model is actually consistency of the pattern that we’d like to predict. Don’t expect we have clean indicators/indices to evaluate the models – as in statistical models. Even statistical models we use regularly to test hypotheses are “true” under a ton of assumptions that we unconsciously ignore.\n\nExample that she gave in the belief polarization project she is working on… Coherence – is defined as a fit with other beliefs depending on the belief system Belief system – is defined as correlation matrices of beliefs but needs to be subjective. To account for subjectivity, she used correlation class analysis (CCA)"
